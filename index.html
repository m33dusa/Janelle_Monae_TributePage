Dirty computer, walk in line
If you look closer you'll recognize
I'm not that special
I'm broke inside
Crashing slowly, the bugs are in me

Dirty computer, breaking down
Picking my face up off the ground
I'll love you in this space and time
'Cause baby all I'll ever be is

Your dirty computer
Dirty computer

Searching for someone to fix my life
Text message, god up in the sky
Oh, if you love me, won't you please reply?
Oh, can't you see that it's only me, your dirty computer?

Dirty computer
Your dirty computer
Dirty computer

I'll love you in this space and time
I'll love you in this space and time

        <pre>You told us we hold these truths to be self-evident:<br> that all men and women are created equal; <br>and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; <br>among these are life, liberty, and the—and the pursuit of happiness

Young, black, wild and free
Naked on a limousine (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Riding through the hood real slow
I love it when we smell the trees (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I just wanna party hard
Sex in the swimming pool (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't need a lot of cash
I just wanna break the rules (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

We don't need another ruler
All of my friends are kings (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm not America's nightmare
I'm the American dream (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Just let me live my life

I want a crazy, classic, life
I want a crazy, classic, life
So if the world should end tonight
I had a crazy, classic, life

I don't need a diamond ring
I don't wanna waste my youth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't wanna live on my knees
I just have to tell the truth, baby (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't wanna be let down
I don't wanna cheat on you (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I just wanna find a God
And I hope she loves me too (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

We don't need another ruler
We don't need another fool (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm not America's nightmare
I'm the American cool (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Just let me live my life

I want a crazy, classic, life
I want a crazy, classic, life
So if the world should end tonight
I had a crazy, classic, life
I want a crazy, classic, life
I want a crazy, classic, life
So if the world should end tonight
I had a crazy, classic, life
Crazy, classic, life

Handcuffed in a bando
White boy in his sandals
Police like a Rambo
Blow it out, blow it out like a candle, Sambo
Me and you was friends, but to them, we the opposite
The same mistake, I'm in jail, you on top of shit
You living life while I'm walking around moppin' shit
Tech kid, backpack, no, you a college kid
All I wanted was to break the rules like you
All I wanted was someone to love me too
But no matter where it was I always stood out
Black Waldo dancing with the thick brows
We was both running naked at the luau
We was both on shrooms praying face down, waist down
Remember when they told you I was too black for ya?
And now my black poppin' like a bra-strap on ya
I was kicked out, said I'm too loud
Kicked out, said I'm too proud
But all I really ever felt was stressed out
Kinda like my afro when it's pressed out

I'm not the kind of girl you take home to your mama now
I tell you no lies (I tell no lies)
Your code is programmed not to love me but you can't pretend
Oh, what a surprise
Maybe it's lust maybe it's love maybe it never ends
Ooh, say your goodbyes (say 'em now)
Play in my hair and nibble there all on my mocha skin
Yeah, just take a byte

Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (help yourself)
It's alright (it's alright)
I won't tell (it feels so good when you nibble on it)
Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (you look so good just help yourself)
Don't think twice (don't think twice)
I won't tell

My random access memory wants you to come again
No, don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)
I saw my therapist she thinks you are my magic sin
Oh, maybe she's right (maybe she's right)
Well I'll just lick an angel just to purify again
Ooh, angels are fun (they're so fun)
So dress me up I'll like it better if we both pretend
Yeah, make love 'till we're numb

Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (just go ahead and help yourself)
It's alright (it's alright)
I won't tell (take a byte)
Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (you look so good just help yourself)
Don't think twice (don't think twice)
I won't tell

Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (help yourself)
It's alright (it's alright)
I won't tell

Take a byte (oh won't you just take a byte)
Help yourself (go on and help yourself)
It's alright
I won't tell

Just take a byte
You look so good just help yourself
It's alright
Take a little byte
Take a little byte
Take a little byte

        <pre>[Janelle Monáe:]
I live my life in a magazine
I live my life on a TV screen
I live my life on birth control
I lost my mind to rock and roll

[Janelle Monáe & Zoë Kravitz:]
And I, I, I hear the sirens calling
And the bombs are falling in the streets
We're all screwed
And ah, ah, ah, it's not perfect, baby
But I go sex crazy
But I feel so screwed
Sex, body
We're gonna crash your party
Let's get screwed
I don't care
You fucked the world up now, we'll fuck it all back down
Let's get, let's get screwed
I, I don't care
We'll put water in your guns
We'll do it all for fun
Let's get screwed

[Zoë Kravitz:]
Wanna get screwed on a holiday
(Wanna get screwed on a holiday)
Wanna get screwed in a matinee
(Wanna get screwed in a matinee)
Wanna get screwed at a festival
(Wanna get screwed at a festival)
Wanna get screwed like an animal

[Janelle Monáe & Zoë Kravitz:]
And I, I, I hear the sirens calling
And the bombs are falling in the streets
We're all screwed
And ah, ah, ah, it's your birthday, baby
But I go sex crazy
But I feel so screwed
Sex, body
We're gonna crash your party
Let's get screwed
I don't care
You fucked the world up now, we'll fuck it all back down
Let's get, let's get screwed
I, I don't care
We'll put water in your guns
We'll do it all for fun
Let's get, let's get screwed

[Janelle Monáe:]
See, if everything is sex
Except sex, which is power
You know power is just sex
You screw me and I'll screw you too
Everything is sex
Except sex, which is power
You know power is just sex
Now ask yourself who's screwing you

[Janelle Monáe & Zoë Kravitz:]

[Janelle Monáe:]
Hundred men telling me cover up my areolas
While they blocking equal pay, sippin' on they Coca Colas
Fake news, fake moves, fake food—what's real?
Still in The Matrix eatin' on the blue pills
The devil met with Russia and they just made a deal
We was marching through the street, they were blocking every bill
I'm tired of hoteps tryna tell me how to feel
For real

This is my palace, champagne in my chalice
I got it all covered like a wedding band
Wondaland, so my alias is Alice
And we gon' start a motherfuckin' pussy riot
Or we gon' have to put 'em on a pussy diet
Look at that, I guarantee I got 'em quiet
Look at that, I guarantee they all inspired
A-town, made it out there
Straight out of Kansas City, yeah we made it out there
Celebrated, graduated, made it pass/fail
Sassy, classy, Kool-Aid with the kale
Momma was a G, she was cleanin' hotels
Poppa was a driver, I was workin' retail
Kept us in the back of the store
We ain't hidden no more, moonlit nigga, lit nigga

Already got a Oscar for the casa
Runnin' down Grammys with the family
Prolly give a Tony to the homies
Prolly get a Emmy dedicated to the
Highly melanated, ArchAndroid orchestrated
Yeah, we highly melanated, ArchAndroid orchestrated

Yeah, Jamanati they still jammin'
Box office numbers, and they doin' outstandin'
Runnin' outta space in my damn bandwagon
Remember when they used to say I look too mannish
Black girl magic, y'all can't stand it
Y'all can't ban it, made out like a bandit
They been trying hard just to make us all vanish
I suggest they put a flag on a whole 'nother planet

Jane Bond, never Jane Doe
And I Django, never Sambo
Black and white, yeah that's always been my camo
It's lookin' like y'all gon' need some more ammo
I cut 'em off, I cut 'em off, I cut 'em off like Van Gogh
Now, pan right for the angle
I got away with murder, no scandal
Cue the violins and violas

We gave you life, we gave you birth
We gave you God, we gave you Earth
We fem the future, don't make it worse
You want the world? Well, what's it worth?
Emoticons, Decepticons, and Autobots
Who twist the plot?
Who shot the sheriff, then fled to Paris
In the darkest hour, spoke truth to power?
Made a fandroid outta yo' girlfriend
Let's get caught downtown in the whirlwind
And paint the city pink, paint the city pink
And tuck the pearls in, just in case the world end

And nigga, down dawg
Nigga move back, take a seat, you were not involved
And hit the mute button
Let the vagina have a monologue
Mansplaining, I fold 'em like origami
What's a wave, baby? This a tsunami
For the culture, I kamikaze
I put my life on a life line
If she the G.O.A.T. now, would anybody doubt it?
If she the G.O.A.T. now, would anybody doubt it?
Do anybody got it? Do anybody got it?
I say anybody got it?

Pink like the inside of your, baby
Pink behind all of the doors, crazy
Pink like the tongue that goes down, maybe
Pink like the paradise found
Pink when you're blushing inside, baby
Pink is the truth you can't hide, maybe
Pink like the folds of your brain, crazy
Pink as we all go insane

So, here we are in the car
Leaving traces of us down the boulevard
I wanna fall through the stars
Getting lost in the dark is my favourite part
Let's count the ways we could make this last forever
Sunny, money, keep it funky
Touch your top and let it down

Ah, yeah
Some like that
Ah, ah
Some like that
Ah, yeah
Some like that
'Cause boy it's cool if you got blue
We got the pink

Pink like the lips around your, maybe
Pink like the skin that's under, baby
Pink where it's deepest inside, crazy
Pink beyond forest and thighs
Pink like the secrets you hide, maybe
Pink like the lid of your eye, baby
Pink is where all of it starts, crazy
Pink like the halls of your heart

Baby, don't make me spell it out for you
All of the feelings that I've got for you
Can't be explained, but I can try for you
Yeah, baby, don't make me spell it out for you
You keep on asking me the same questions (why?)
And second guessing all my intentions
Should know by the way I use my compression
That you've got the answers to my confessions

It's like I'm powerful with a little bit of tender
An emotional, sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better
There's nothing better

That's just the way you make me feel

You know I love it, so please don't stop it
You got me right here, in your jean pocket (right now)
Laying your body on a shag carpet, ooh
You know I love it, so please don't stop it

It's like I'm powerful with a little bit of tender
An emotional, sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better

Good God, I can't help it! Ah!
Hey, that's just the way that I feel, yeah

Now go on girl and use that sauce (that sauce)
If you don't, then that's your loss (your loss)
If you don't, then that's your loss
Turn it up, don't turn it off
Got everbody looking in your cup (your cup)
You know they wanna drink it up (drink it up)
You know they wanna drink it up (drink it up)
And if they try to take it you say

[Janelle Monáe (Pharell Williams):]
Down, love
(Don't think about it)
Down, love
(Don't think about it)
Down, love
(You're number one)
Down, love
(And don't you doubt it)
Down, love
(Don't think about it)
Down, love
(Don't think about it)
Down, love
(Don't think about it)
Stop!
Now, shine

[Janelle Monáe:]
I got the juice (juice tonight)
I'm the chaser, don't need a mixer
I got the juice (juice tonight)
Baby, I'm the plug and the filter
I got the juice (juice tonight)
How many damn times I got to tell y'all?
I got the juice (juice tonight)
Baby, I got the juice (I got the juice tonight)

[Pharell Williams:]
It's a freak, freak scene in it
Wet, wet dream in it
Wakin' up like wean in it
Me in your jeans in it
Yellow like pee in it
Oh no, I mean me in it
Know it ain't lean in it
But it's got a little kink in it
Kinda make you wanna drink in it
Got a little cream in it
But I feel like being in it
Work me up like caffeine in it
Drippin' like a extra large but the top is too small, yeah
Here, let me wipe you off
Look inside, I can't wait to get you home at all, nah
These cupholders are small
Can't believe what is in it, ya
Tastes like a good time
My ring was foggy in my business
Short turn, memory fried (brain on)
What you got, girl, is tough as shit
Can't nothin' else fuck with it (hey!)
Pressed, please, that fresh squeezed juice
There could never be a supplement

[Janelle Monáe:]
Got juice for all my lovers
Got juice for all my wives (hey!)
My juice is my religion
Got juice between my thighs (hey!)
Now, ask the angels, baby
My juice is so divine (hey!)
Ain't no juice quite like yours
Ain't no juice quite like mine (hey!)
If you try to grab my pussy cat, this pussy grab you back (hey!)
If you try to grab my pussy cat, this pussy grab you back (hey!)
If you try to grab my pussy cat, this pussy grab you back (hey!)
This pussy grab you back
Give you pussy cataracts (hey!)

Yeah, I got the juice
I'm the truth, you can see it
Throw it up, throw it up
I'm the plug when you need it
I'm the truth, I'm the truth
Yeah, yeah, I got the juice
Dirty computer
Dirty computer
You can break me, break me down
If you want it you can get it
You can take my, take my crown
I don't want it, I don't need it
Yeah, yeah, I got the juice
Yeah, yeah, I got the juice
Dirty computer
Dirty comp...

        <pre>Sometimes a mystery, sometimes I'm free
Depending on my mood or my attitude
Sometimes I wanna roll or stay at home
Walking contradiction, guess I’m factual and fiction

A little crazy, little sexy, little cool
Little rough around the edges but I keep it smooth
I'm always left of center and that's right where I belong
I'm the random minor note you hear in major songs

And I like that
I don't really give a fuck if I was just the only one
Who likes that
I never like to follow, follow all around and chase the sun

Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
I like that

I don't care what I look like but I feel good
Better than amazing, and better than I could
Told the whole world, I'm the venom and the antidote
Take a different type of girl to keep the whole world afloat

Cause I'm crazy and I'm sexy and I'm cool
Little rough around the edges but I keep it smooth
I'm always left of center and that's right where I belong
I'm the random minor note you hear in major songs

And I like that
I don't really give a fuck if I was just the only one
Who likes that
I never like to follow, follow all around and chase the sun

Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
I like that

I remember when you called me weird
We was in math class third row I was sitting by you
Right before Mr. Ammond's class
Cause my mom couldn't afford new J's
Polos, thrift store, thrift clothes that was all I knew
Do you remember?
Uh, I remember when you laughed when I cut my perm off
And you rated me a six
I was like, "Damn"
But even back then with the tears in my eyes
I always knew I was the shit

I like that
I don't really give a fuck if I was just the only one
Who likes that
I never like to follow, follow all around and chase the sun

Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
I like that

        <pre>Come, let me kiss you right there
Wake you up like sunrise
On the backs of your thighs
I'm gonna pray you this prayer
That I keep in my mind
As a lovely reminder

Even though you tell me you love me
I'm afraid that you just love my disguise
Taste my fears and light your candle to my raging fire
Of broken desire

But don't judge me
I know I got issues
But they drown when I kiss you
Don't judge me
Baptize me with ocean
Recognize my devotion

The water's perfectly good
Let's reintroduce ourselves
From a free point of view
If I'm gon' sin, it's with you
Tattoo your love on my heart
Let the rumors be true

Even though you tell me you love me
I'm afraid that you just love my disguise
Taste my fears and light your candle to my raging fire
The dirty desire

But don't judge me
I know I got issues
But they drown when I kiss you
Don't, don't judge me
Baptize me with ocean
Recognize my devotion

What if I, what if I touched you right there?

Even though you say that you love me
Is it me or do you love my disguise?
If I missed you, would you think I was lonely
If I say what's on my mind?

Even though you say that you love me
Is it me or do you love my disguise?
If I kissed you, would you think I was lonely
If I let you inside?

Come, let me kiss you right there
But if I kissed you right there
Would you tremble inside, or just call it a night?
What if I gave you a show
You could touch if you like
Right there
If I kissed you would you think I was lonely?
If I

It feels so good
Come, let me kiss you right there
Just say that you love me

        <pre>Even when you're upset, these words of love
'Cause God is love
Allah is love
Jehovah is love
So, don't let your expressions, even of anger
Be confused or misconstrued
Turn them into words of expression
That can be understood by using words of love

        <pre>All the kids run around playing free and fun, while the dogs lap around the can
Falling down, climbing trees, swimming in the river, no life jacket on their backs
Daughters sharpen their knives and they hunt for food, others watch their children grow
Mothers going to work and they shake the hands of a corporate tycoon's ghost

And I'm afraid (ahhhh)
I'm so afraid (ahhhh)
What if I lose?
Is what I think to myself
I'm fine in my shell
I'm afraid of it all, afraid of loving you

I'm a gift and a curse to the wilderness when the leaves only turn to brown
The birds fly high and they wink at all of the grandmothers on the ground
Rain pours down in the village dens, my cousins fetch for lunch
While I sit in my room writing letters to my church and things and such

'Cause I'm afraid (ahhhh)
I'm so afraid (ahhhh)
What if I lose?
Is what I think to myself
I'm fine in my shell
I'm afraid of it all, afraid of loving you

Cousins all in the creek
Riding high, ride with zeal
And the rain pours down, the ghetto dancin', yeah

I'm so afraid (ahhhh)
I'm so afraid (ahhhh)
What if I lose?
Is what I think to myself
I'm fine in my shell
I'm afraid of it all, afraid of loving you
I'm afraid, afraid of loving you

Cousins all in the creek
Riding high, ride with zeal
And the rain pours down, the ghetto dancin', yeah

        <pre>Hold on, don't fight your war alone
Halo around you, don't have to face it on your own
We will win this fight
All souls be brave
We'll find a way to heaven
We'll find a way

War is old, so is sex
Let's play god, you go next
Hands go up, men go down
Try my luck, stand my ground
Die in church, live in jail
Say her name, twice in hell
Uncle Sam kissed a man
Jim Crow Jesus rose again

I like my woman in the kitchen
I teach my children superstitions
I keep my two guns on my blue nightstand
A pretty young thang, she can wash my clothes
But she'll never ever wear my pants

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Learned the words from my mom and dad
Cross my heart and I hope to die
With a big old piece of American pie
Love me baby, love me for who I am
Fallen angels singing, "clap your hands"
Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
I'm not crazy, baby, naw
I'm American
I'm American
I'm American
I'm American

Seventy-nine cent to your dollar
All that bullshit from white-collars
You see my color before my vision
Sometimes I wonder if you were blind
Would it help you make a better decision?

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Learned the words from my mom and dad
Cross my heart and I hope to die
With a big old piece of American pie
Just love me baby, love me for who I am
Fallen angels singing, "clap your hands"
Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
I'm not crazy, baby, naw
I'm American
I'm American
I'm American
I'm American

Let me help you in here
Until women can get equal pay for equal work
This is not my America
Until same gender loving people can be who they are
This is not my America
Until black people can come home from a police stop without being shot in the head
This is not my America
Until poor whites can get a shot at being successful
This is not my America
I can't hear nobody talkin' to me

Just love me baby, love me for who I am
Fallen angels singing, "clap your hands"
Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
I'm not crazy, baby, naw
I'm American (love me baby)
I'm American (love me for who I am)

Until Latinos and Latinas don't have to run from walls
This is not my America
But I tell you today that the devil is a liar
Because it's gon' be my America before it's all over

Please sign your name on the dotted line
